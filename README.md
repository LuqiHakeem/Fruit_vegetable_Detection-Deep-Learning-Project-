# Fruit_vegetable_Detection-Deep-Learning-Project-
A Deep Learning-based object detection case study using YOLO to detect Banana and Potato. The model was trained on a custom annotated dataset and evaluated using standard detection metrics.

# 🍌🥔 Banana & Potato Object Detection using YOLO

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Deep Learning-based object detection system developed as a case study to detect two object classes: **Banana** and **Potato** using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of real-time object detection using a custom annotated dataset. Unlike traditional image classification, this system detects and localizes objects by generating bounding boxes around detected fruits.

This project serves as a foundational study for understanding modern computer vision techniques and their practical applications.

## ⚙️ Implementation Workflow

### 1️⃣ Dataset Preparation
- Images of Banana and Potato were collected.
- Bounding boxes were annotated in YOLO format.
- Dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets.

### 2️⃣ Model Configuration
- Created `data.yaml` configuration file.
- Defined class labels:
  - 0: Banana
  - 1: Potato

### 3️⃣ Model Training
- Used pre-trained YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n.pt`).
- Fine-tuned using custom dataset.
- Monitored training loss and evaluation metrics.

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
Model performance evaluated using:
- mAP (mean Average Precision)
- Precision
- Recall

### 5️⃣ Inference / Prediction
- Tested trained model on unseen images.
- Generated bounding boxes with confidence scores.

## ▶️ How to Train the Model

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

---

### 2️⃣ Train the YOLO Model

Ensure dataset and `data.yaml` are correctly configured.

```bash
yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

Explanation:
- `data.yaml` → Dataset configuration file
- `yolov8n.pt` → Pre-trained YOLOv8 nano model
- `epochs=50` → Number of training iterations
- `imgsz=640` → Image size for training

Trained weights will be saved in:

```
runs/detect/train/
```

---

## 🔍 How to Run Inference

```bash
yolo detect predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=sample_images/
```

Output results will be saved in:

```
runs/detect/predict/
```

---

## 📊 Model Output

The trained model will:
- Detect Banana and Potato
- Generate bounding boxes
- Display confidence scores for each detected object

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Expand to multi-class fruit detection
- Implement real-time webcam detection
- Deploy model on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Improve accuracy using larger dataset
